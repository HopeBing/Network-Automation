Cisco FMC Project (5/14/2020)

Program Update:

The program is somewhat slow due to FMC request restrictions. There is plans to resolve that in the future. 
You can start the DB backup and use the query the new query to tool to search id desired.

Requirement:

1. Delete old DB file if you have used the prgram before
or
Create another DB file by changing the following code:

mydb = sqlite3.connect("FMC") # Change FMC to something else, Line 30

Added DB and DB tables. I removed all print statements and and added DB write/update statement. Current wll write:

1. Source Network
2. Destination Networks
3. Source Ports
4. Destination Ports
5. Source Zone
6. Destination Zone

Al working on data validation but i believe a got most.

Ive update the porgram with a tool to view your DB. Just select an option and input.

Requirement:

1. Ensure DB matches the one written in the FMC.pu. Line 8 in the FMC_Query_Tool
