Cisco FMC Project (5/9/2020)

Added DB and DB tables. I removed all print statement and andded DB write/update statement. Current wll write:

1. Source Network
2. Destination Networks
3. Source Ports
4. Destination Ports
5. Source Zone
6. Destination Zone

The program will also log all objects used in another table. This code will need to some more work to write nest objects.
For now it will write top level objects.

If you want to make a test run on your FMC you can use the following link to view your DB
