* This is not a completed program. 

The code is a second option to my FMC program. Since the first option is slow due to FMC limitations and response time on GET request
I decided to fully customize the program. In this code I added:

1. My own module which uses sockets and a custom HTTP request code. Not that the request module was awseome, because it is,
   it just didnt give me the option to make custom sockets, or use multiple source ip/nic from my server.
   
2. Custom classes to give me the option to mutlithread different class instances

So now whats possible? Now i can scan about 10 rules per minute instead of 4. The job can take 3 hours, instead of 10. You can add as many
ips as you want for the job because each ip will get its own instance. In my case ive just added secondary ips to my primary nic. 
The more you added the shorter runtime.

When intiating the job i use the FMC query filter (offset) to start at different rules.

Still working on:

1. The program intiator file. Its still basic but will get alot more attention soon.
2. Getting each proccess/instance to stop so the rules scanning don't overlap.
3. Data validation
4. More HTTP code.
