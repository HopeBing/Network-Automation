Network Automation Repositories:

This is my open source programabilty and automation project. All source code is open to EVERYONE. All source code has tested within
a live network, not simulation/DevNet environment.I will be updating my code a few times a week so come back or clone daily.

What will you find in these repositories?

1. NETCONF/YANG source code - Although NETCONFIG/YANG has been around for a few years, Cisco has started to push progrmability and automation. 
   I've not been able to find many examples beyond interface confugrations and statistics on the internet. This is the big reason I chose to dive into this further.
   The source code will show you more that the basic tasks mentioned above. Please view the README in the NETCONF/YANG folder for the full prgram 
   description.
   
2. Cisco ACI source code - Cisco ACI programabilty/automation has been around a while so im sure these programs are nothing new. In my case I usually use the 
    REST interface with XML to push my configuration but wanted to explore other options to do common task. Please view the README in the DataCenter(ACI) folder 
    for the full program description.
   
3. Meraki SDWAN source code (Coming Soon)
