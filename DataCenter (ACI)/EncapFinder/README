This program is a branch from my vlan to vxlan mistmatch program. Instead of getting information about mismatched vlans, how about we get 
information about any vlan. Everything from access policies to location will be ouputed.

* All of my outputs are modifed for confedentiality. Output is still exact other than wording.

*Both py files are needed to run this program.
*One file is needed to run the program:  "C:\Python\ACI\Get_ACI.xml"
