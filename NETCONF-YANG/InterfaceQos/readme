Using IETF-Interface YANG Model, this program allows you to capture interface queue traffic. The different types of data will come 
from each job you run, current queue traffic, hostorical queue traffic (last polled, ) and 10 second polling queue traffic. Once 
traffic is capture and calculatedyou will be presented with two different charts

Chart 1#

Current queue data w/ historical differences. There difference are not totals, but instead 1 seconds differences. Totals can be
calculated my multipling the column date by the total seconds between polls. Last poll daye & converted time (seconds) is located
above the interface chart.

Chart 2#

Estimated queue traffic per seconds. This traffic is calculated with the data collected before and after the polling time and 
divided by the polling time.


All data is stored in a local SQL Lite database. Please do not modify the python SQL code or the program will not work correctly

Enjoy!
