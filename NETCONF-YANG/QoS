QoS Program:

The purpose of the program is desing to create QoS polcies with NETCONF/YANG. Shownbelow are the options available with in the program


1. Configure Class-map

  Configure class-maps. Apply options such as match-any/all, tags (CS, DSCP, and AF). All configurations are mapped to a dictionary which will
  be during other parts of the programs.
  
2. Configure Policy-map

  Configure child polices. Apply options such as WRED (DSCP, Precidence based, ) Queue-limts, bandwidth/priority options. 
  Uses class map dictnary to automaticlly map queues to class-map names. Builds a child policy dictionary to be used elsewhere.
  
3. Confgure Policy-map (shaping)
  
  Confgure parent policies. Apply options such as shape/police (Bits, ) nested class, and automaticlly maps child policy via child policy dictionaries
  
4. Interface Selection

  Apply Parent policy to an interface
  
5. Build Policy File
  
  After options 1 - 4 are completed, the program will use the dictionaries created in those options to build your configration file.
  
6. Modify Dicts

  Dictionaries built in options 1 - 4 can be modified in this option. Use the far left which are dictionary keys to make you selection
  
  Example:
  
  Class:          test1
  _____


  Prematch:       match-any
  Tag_1:          cs1
  Tag_2:          cs2
  
  If i want to modify cs1, I would enter "Tag_1" or change match-any to match-all, I would selct "Prematch"

7. Send Configuration

  Send QoS policy
  
8. Get Configuration
  
  Get current configuration via Paramiko.
