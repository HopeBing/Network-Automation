This program creates a local SQL Lite database utilizing the sqllite3 python module. Although you can use this code to create any
database you want, I created it as a logging location for network automation jobs. The datebase is stored locally in the folder of
the .py file.

As the program is an example of possabilitites, I used the capabilities option to test NETCONF connectivity and enablement. Once 
the capabilities operation is complete the DB entry will be added if not already there, or updateded with the automation protocol,
date, time, model, and serial. NOTE* if you trying to a part id and serial from cisco switch, it doesn't, router works fine. 

Import devices via excel spreadsheet. The posted program only reads one hundred rows, and two columns (You can adjust.) My testing
was with IP in column one, location is column two. Example database shown below after import.



          IP                 Protocol      Location         Status              Date             Time              Model           Serial
         ____                 ________      ________         ______             ____            ______             ______          ______

       10.1.1.130             Unknown         BAL            New            2020-02-20         14:27:23           Unknown         Unknown
       10.1.1.131             Unknown         BAL            New            2020-02-20         14:10:57           Unknown         Unknown
       10.1.1.132             Unknown         BAL            New            2020-02-20         14:10:57           Unknown         Unknown
 
 
Example of database after the capabilities job:


          IP                 Protocol      Location         Status              Date             Time              Model           Serial
         ____                 ________      ________         ______             ____            ______             ______          ______


       10.1.1.130            NET/YANG         POC           Pass            2020-02-20         14:46:28        ISR4331/K9     FDO185019DF
       10.1.1.131            NET/YANG         POC           Pass            2020-02-20         14:46:34           Unknown         Unknown
       10.1.1.132             Unknown         POC           Fail            2020-02-20         14:46:38           Unknown         Unknown


Filter through the database using serial, location, ip, and status. Status with be New for imported, failed for failingthe last job,
and Pass for passing the last job.

Enjoy
