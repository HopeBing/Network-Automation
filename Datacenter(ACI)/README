All testing is done with my network which runs ACI in multiple Datacenters, not test lab evniroments! This program was built from my postmans
collection which also has been verifed in Production, not test labs enviroments.

This program is for basic Cisco ACI configuration.In this program you will be able to do the following:

Create Tenants
Create Application Profiles
Create Endpoint Groups
Create Bridge Domains
Create Contracts

Configurations are created and saved to local file. Once saved,these configuration files can be copied into to postman and sent if desired.
Modification of file can be done directly from file (open local xml file,) or through the program. If modication via program is diesired, 
one must enter ALL config options again until further notice. If modification is done directly from file (open local xml file) that file 
can be pushed via SEND CONFIG menu option or fro postman.
