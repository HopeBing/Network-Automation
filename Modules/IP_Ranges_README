IP_Ranges Module

This module allows you to enter IP ranges, and individual IPs on the same line. Only support class C right now

Use Case:

I need to scan or login multiple devices at once and entering every IP is time consuming. 

How it works:

Enter you desired range as - 192.168.128.1-10. All ips between one and ten will be unpacked and stored to a list

                                Returns: ['192.168.128.1', '192.168.128.2', '192.168.128.3', '192.168.128.4', 
                                          '192.168.128.5', '192.168.128.6', '192.168.128.7', '192.168.128.8', 
                                          '192.168.128.9', '192.168.128.10']

                             192.168.128.1-10,11,15,100. All ips will be unpacked and stored to a list
                             
                                Returns ['192.168.128.1', '192.168.128.2', '192.168.128.3', '192.168.128.4', 
                                         '192.168.128.5', '192.168.128.6', '192.168.128.7', '192.168.128.8', 
                                         '192.168.128.9', '192.168.128.10', '192.168.128.11', '192.168.128.15',
                                         '192.168.128.100']

                             192.168.128.1-1,10,20,30,35. Since "-" is the split and we need all single ips, 
                             we just close the range using 1-1
                             
                                  Returns: ['192.168.128.1', '192.168.128.10', '192.168.128.20', '192.168.128.30',
                                           '192.168.128.35']
  
  
  Once the list have been unpacked, they are return to the calling function/module to be iterated through
